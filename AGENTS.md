- Always escalate a permission error in a command to the user.
- Never touch the git index.lock. If escalation does not help, just retry.
- Never commit the checkout blindly with `-A`. Always add files explicitly, potentially multiple at a time.
- Commit in sensible chunks. Don't mix multiple topics into one commit.
- Use a commit title convention: "area/subarea: short what has been done". E.g. "model/nanoschnack: do x".
- Ensure to run `source .venv/bin/activate` when committing so the pre-commit hook works.
- Comment style: add a one-line comment above small blocks of logically connected lines; no blank line before the first block comment in a scope, and a blank line before each subsequent block comment; add a 3–5 line class docstring to explain purpose and constraints.
